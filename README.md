I had to create a very basic TCP connection via sockets in C for a network programming course. The server that I implemented listens for incoming connections, accepts them, 
and is able to receive messages from clients. The client program that I implemented was established to communicate with a server via a TCP connection. 

This was a basic, but interesting project in C. I am somewhat new to the programming language & this was a great way for me to learn more about the language while also 
learning about socket and network programming. I have deepened my undersatnding of network programming, and the way that networks work in general. The research that I did for 
this course and project I found very interesting. This was one of the main guides that I used for this class, of  which I found very helpful: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/
